# chatgpt_clone

ChatGPT clone created using flask, tailwindCSS, MongoDB and OpenAI's API

New requests are sent to OpenAI's API and the AI generated answer is fetched. The question and its generated answer are stored in a MongoDB cluster.
Next time the same question is asked, it is fetched from the cluster to reduce load on API and generate faster results.
